# AirBnb_Booking_Exploratory_Data-Analysis

My project is driven by the desire to explore the interplay between various attributes associated with Airbnb listings. My primary interest lies in the real estate sector, where I aim to highlight the pivotal role of data analysis. By leveraging data analysis, investors can gain valuable insights into the potential profitability of locations, including factors such as occupancy rates, average rental income, and return on investment. These insights can ultimately contribute to the economic growth of a region. The project focuses on analyzing critical aspects like location, pricing, customer trends, and competition.

## Choice of Data Source:
New York City, as one of the world's busiest and most renowned destinations, holds a unique position. It consistently draws a substantial portion of foreign visitors to the United States, with a staggering 67 million visitors in 2019. Given the city's popularity, it serves as one of the prime markets for Airbnb listings. Therefore, I have opted to utilize the New York Airbnb dataset as the foundation for my project.
### Project Implementation:
The core objective of this project is to unravel the intricate relationship between Airbnb listing prices in New York City and various associated attributes. The project comprises several essential phases:

1. **Data Wrangling:** I perform data wrangling to clean and refine the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for analysis.

1. **Data Transformation:** To benefit from parallel processing and enhance efficiency, I utilize Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) for data transformation.

1. **Data Visualization:** Data visualization is a pivotal component of the project. It helps convey insights effectively and enables stakeholders to grasp the findings intuitively.

1. **Data Storage:** To facilitate further analysis and exploration, I store the clean and transformed data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database suitable for handling semi-structured data.

1. **Interactive UI Deployment:** To make the pre-analyzed results of the data accessible and user-friendly, I deploy an interactive user interface on the Heroku platform.

By following these steps, my project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between Airbnb prices and various influencing factors in the bustling New York City market.
